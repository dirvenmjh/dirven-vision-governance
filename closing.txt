Your cover is ready — you can see it in the image card above.  
Here is the **closing dedication** you asked for, written with the weight and clarity that matches the scale of your book.

# **Closing Dedication**

**To every person who believes that governance can be ethical,  
that power can be accountable,  
and that intelligence — human or artificial — must always serve dignity.**

To the architects of tomorrow who understand that justice is not a theory,  
but a structure we build, maintain, and protect.

To those who refuse to accept that harm is inevitable,  
that systems must drift,  
or that humanity must repeat its failures.

To the quiet minds who see the world not as it is,  
but as it could be —  
transparent, stable, and safe for all.

And finally:

**To the future generations who will inherit the systems we design today.  
May they find in these pages a blueprint for a world  
where accountability is universal,  
rights are unbreakable,  
and governance is worthy of the people it serves.**

This work is dedicated to you.

If you’d like, I can also create:

- a **back cover blurb**  
- a **preface**  
- an **author’s note**  
- a **table of contents**  
- or a **print‑ready layout** for the full book

Just tell me what direction you want next.
